新探月时代来临，未来的您缺席了吗

The new moon exploration era is coming. Are you absent in the future?
Baby is not a metaphysical product. It is a digital smart contract that encapsulates real ownership. It records the hard-to-tweak ownership with distributed dynamic data accounts, allowing you to take the first step in exploring the universe and finally obtain your own moon ownership. （The first 999 years after the contract owner returned to Earth on 365 days）.宝贝并非形而上的产品，是封装有真实权属的数字智能合约，以分布式动态数据账目记录难以篡改的所有权，让你坚实迈出探求宇宙的第一步，最终获得属于自己的月表权属（以合约所有者中第一个驻月365天以上安返回地球后的999年）。

The principle of the contract is: the contract intent recognizes the contractual rights established by the prior contract owner, and then practices the purchase of the homogeneous contract （which also recognizes that the purchase expenditure is completely used for the peaceful development of the human deep space business）, with a consensus The way to write to the decentralized database books and continue to broadcast （computer blockchain principle）. When the consensus reaches a certain amount, the higher the dispersion, the more stable the contract and the tampering.Greatly used in important fields such as digital copyright, originality, asset rights, and judicial deposit.合约原理为：合约意向者认可在先合约拥有者所确立的合约权益，进而实践同质合约的购入（亦认可此购买支出完全用于和平发展人类深空事业），以一种共识接续的方式向分散的数据库账本执行权益写入并持续广播（计算机区块链原理）。当共识抵达一定量，离散度越高、合约越稳固而不可篡改，极大应用于数字版权、原创、资产权益、司法存证等重要领域。

【Note: As a historical and future consensus on human society, the contract retains redundant parts of the past and future human contribution to the space industry. Its own/relatives reach more than 51% of the consensus, which is naturally owned and can be automatically One distribution contract】

【注：作为承接人类社会的历史与未来共识，合约保留既往和将来人类对太空事业做出贡献者的冗余部分，其本人/亲属在共识度达成51%以上，即为天然拥有，可自动分配合约一份】



共识小盒代你遨游太空

Consensus box for you to travel in space
The first batch of 88,000 contracts was launched as the cornerstone contract. The follow-up contracts must have no such cost-effectiveness. The accessory package with the purchase and delivery has a consensus box. In this way, you will come to a lunar journey that says you will leave. ^首批共推出88万份合约作为基石合约，后续合约一定无此划算，购入寄出的附件包中带一个共识盒子。这样，你就来一场说走就走的月球旅程吧^



是个依据合约预置的驻月计划，经过努力获得的比预想的更多

It is a preset month-based plan based on the contract, and more than expected


以贡献度获取合约，越接近实现登月目的，合约意义、价值会越大，反之合约低迷

To obtain a contract with contribution, the closer to achieving the purpose of landing on the moon, the greater the meaning and value of the contract, and vice versa.
Ah, why is it 999, don't you say that the moon is not eternal?咦，为什么是999呢，你不是说月球不是永恒的吗？

Scientists have determined that the Moon and Earth are about 4.6 billion years old, and the Solar System has about 5 billion years. There is nothing eternal in the world. Taking the history of the Earth and the Moon as a day, human civilization of 5,000 years is only 0.1 seconds. It is the most appropriate method to use the mapping method to project the existing social system on the information layer, so the contract reflects the flexibility of the cornerstone consensus for 999 years.经过科学家测定，月球与地球的年岁都约46亿年左右，太阳系还有大约50亿年时间。世界上不存在永恒不变的东西。以地月历史视为一天，人类五千年文明仅若相当于0.1秒。用映射方式在信息层投射既有社会制度是最合适的方法延续，因此合约以999年来体现基石共识的灵活性。

But if you think that the human aerospace footprint and way of thinking remained only on the moon for 999 years after it was stationed on the moon, it is likely to be wrong. After 999, based on the new interstellar consensus, it is not impossible to re-appoint it to be permanent-before and after the moon landing, we must carefully develop (information resources) and make the best application in a limited time, which can produce the greatest value.但若认为在驻扎月球之后的999年间，人类的宇航足迹与思维方式依旧仅仅固守在月球那很可能就错误了。999年之后以星际新共识做为基础，重约定为永久也不是没可能——登月前后，都要认真开发（信息资源），以有限的时间做最佳应用，可以产生价值的最大。



合约意义何在、为啥只有61.8%的权属呢？

What is the meaning of the contract, and is it only 61.8% of the ownership?
What is the significance of making this contract?
制定此合约，其意义何在？
The contract was developed to stimulate people's desire for space exploration. Imagine: If you have a poem and a place far away in the night sky, then your look will naturally translate into practical action. The funds of the contract will be used for the peaceful development of human beings in the near-Earth orbit and even deep space, and the realization of the monthly plan and the lunar information plan will be promoted. Although the box is simple, it can carry the consensus of everyone and the realization of the information network. It builds the moon into a smart planet with information value and leads to the consensus of peaceful use and development（I feel that on the earth, it is inevitable that the real Internet of Everything cannot be realized.）.合约制定是为了激发人们对太空探索的欲望——试想：如果自己就有个诗与远方在夜空眺目可及的地方，那么你的仰望就会自然转化为实践的行动力。而合约的资金将全部用于人类和平发展近地轨道乃至深空事业用途，推进驻月计划、月球信息计划的实现。盒子虽简陋，但它联网后可以承载所有人的共识以及信息网的实现，把月球首先建为一个具有信息价值的智慧星球，并导向和平利用与开发的共识（有感于在地球上可是必然无法实现真正的万物互联）

Why is the contract only allocated 61.8% of the ownership?
为何合约只分配有61.8%的权属？
It is clear that the earth is the shared wealth and homeland of all mankind, and the moon is also the shared wealth and homeland of all mankind. With this consensus, we have developed a contract on the moon to map human society models and lead development. Exploring and developing in the blank monthly table, distinguishing the interface between social wealth and shared wealth, we must comprehensively consider the reasonable proportion of feedback to achieve a more satisfactory consensus result, and then inspire the enthusiasm for the month and development, accelerate the human being is too slow Space process人们清楚知道地球是全人类的共有财富与家园，而月球也是全人类共有财富与家园，以此共识，我们在月球上映射人类社会模型的办法制定合约并导向开发。在空白月表进行探索开发，区分社会财富与共有财富界面，要全面考虑合理的回馈比例才能磨合出较圆满的共识结果，进而激励出驻月向往与开发热情，加速人类已实在太于缓慢的太空进程

At present, there is no more reasonable and reasonable mathematical ratio than 0.618. Therefore, the cornerstone contract selects 61.8% as the balance value, so as to encourage the early pioneers, the later contracts will be more reasonable adjustment based on actual feedback - of course, 880,000 copies. The maximum value of the cornerstone contract is 0.132×10^7 square kilometers (according to human nature, it will be less than this value). It only accounts for 3.79×10^7 square kilometers of the lunar surface, about 3.48% (the monthly table is covered with undulating potholes, according to calculation The total number of craters with a diameter of more than 1 km is more than 30,000, which is 7-10% of the surface area of the moon. The actual spreading area will cause this value to be much less than 3.48%, and the estimate will be less than 1%). And the universe is so big, everyone wants to see it, the opportunity will be more, stepping on the paving of the predecessors, sailing the stars and the sea, it is the most authentic portrayal of the predecessors planting trees and people.在目前还找不到比0.618更优美合理的数学比例，因此基石合约选取61.8%为平衡数值，以资对早期先行者的鼓励，后期合约必将根据实际反馈进行更合理调整——当然88万份基石合约取最大值0.132×10^7平方千米（根据人之天性，会小于此数值很多）只占月球表面3.79×10^7平方千米，约3.48%（月表布满起伏坑洞，根据测算直径大于1公里的环形山总数3万多个,即占月球表面积的7～10%，实际铺展面积将导致此数值远远小于3.48%，估测将小于1%）。而宇宙那么大，大家都想去看看，机会将更多，踏着前人的铺垫扬帆启航星辰大海，正是前人植树后人纳凉的最真实写照



基石合约与权属的公摊

Cornerstone contract and tenure
Does the ownership have a public share?
权属有公摊部分吗？
There are indeed 2.8% of the public share, which you can call a public share or libro-are, for setting up public facilities or public routes: you can be with a neighbor (perhaps a leader of a country, a famous elite, a well-known scientist, etc.) The leisurely owners will work together to plan how to build a space garden, a moon kindergarten, a bumper yard, an observatory, a weightless trampoline, a space golf course, etc. in the community. Of course, we can also explore the planning of the lunar community pathway and jointly develop a road for development. Meaningful name, or name your front door by your own name.确有2.8%的公摊部分，你可以称之为公摊或libro-are，用于设立公众设施或公共路线：你可以和邻居（也许是某国领袖、著名精英人士、知名科学家等）在无等闲辈业主群一起筹划如何在小区内建设太空田园、月娃幼儿园、碰碰车场、天文台、失重蹦床台、太空高尔夫场等，当然也可以一起探讨规划月球社区通路，共同给开辟的道路取个有意义的名字，或用自己名字命名门前小径

Encourage aid groups to buy together their idols, because the brains of FANS are often more romantic than the moon, and they have the same passion as the idols. They will become the outstanding scientists in the space industry or the founders of the lunar film base. , embellished into a unique landscape of the moon, is a favorite of parents who are concerned about the development of reality.鼓励应援团体也可以给自己的偶像购买一起共同建设，因为粉丝的脑洞往往比月亮还具浪漫，也有与偶像同一屋檐的实践热忱，未来将成为太空事业的优秀科学家或月球影视基地的创建者，点缀成为月面独特的风景，是注重现实发展的父母所乐见的

What is the cornerstone node and the cornerstone contract?
什么是基石节点、基石合约？
With the most decentralized nodes to store a consistent contractual ledger, anyone (not limited to the contract owner and IoT information participants) can check the ledger at any time to achieve the goal of transparency and consistency. 880,000 is the basic value that can be difficult to tamper with the initial dispersal purpose. Therefore, the first batch of 880,000 nodes is called the cornerstone node, and the running contract is called the cornerstone contract, which is the strategic basis for subsequent contract adjustment. Unremovable modification is also based on the degree of dispersion. Imagine: Is it easy to destroy the eggs in a basket and easily destroy them collectively? The consensus book is difficult to change based on the scattered data between the earth and the moon. Of course, the application of cryptography is more solid.以尽可能分散的节点共同存储一致的合约总账，任何人（不限于合约所有人，还有物联网信息参与者）都可以随时进行账本核对查询，达到共识透明化不可篡改的目的。88万是能初步满足分散目的而实现难以篡改的基数值，因此首批88万个节点被称为基石节点，其中运行的合约称为基石合约，是后续合约调整的策略基础。不可篡改性还基于离散程度，试想：鸡蛋放在一个篮子容易集体被摧毁还是分散多个鸡窝逐一找出后摧毁容易？共识账本正是基于地月间各处分散的数据实现的难以更改，当然其中还有密码学的应用更加固了这种特性



了解月球，学习月球知识，为登陆打好基石

Learn about the moon, learn about the moon, and lay the foundation for landing
Can I choose the location of the moon?
我可以对月亮地点选择么？
We use the order confirmation time as the location selection. After the conditions of 880,000 nodes are met, we will select the location according to the order, and record it in the lunar ownership account and one person. Finally, we use the lunar latitude and longitude value as the anchor. Determine the association. In astronomy, we know that about 59% of the lunar surface can be seen by people because of the pendulum phenomenon. It can be clearly observed with astronomical telescopes. Therefore, there are more scenic spots and more convenient for observation and communication. Then the moon back area must be bad, although the hidden parts are invisible, but in the future, it may bring more surprises and surprises to the people. Therefore, the human footsteps should be as wide and wide as possible. And the choice of location is actually a good time for the whole family to learn space knowledge and solve problems. You will get a lot of knowledge about the moon, such as: the landform of the moon, the distribution of resources, the lighting conditions, and the lowest time of the cabin.Chang'e the most likely place to live, how to find laurel trees, etc., the children who grow up in this family atmosphere of knowledge creation will inevitably become a promising and open-minded and promising person to win in the Mars era. It can be said that it is planting a valuable seed, enlightening a new style.我们以订单的确认时间先后做为地点择选排序，在88万个节点条件满足后进行按该先后进行地点选择，统一记录于月球权属账本并人手一份，终以月球的经纬值作为锚定关联。在天文学上，由于钟摆现象我们知道实际上有约59%的月面可以被人们看见，用天文望远镜就可以清晰观测，因此风景名胜比较多，于观察与通讯也较为方便。那么月背区是否就一定不好呢，隐藏的部位虽然看不见，但日后说不定带给人们更多的意外及惊喜就是月背，因此人类踏足月球足迹应尽量辽阔而分布广泛。而且地点择选实际是个全家一起学习太空知识、遇题解题的好时机，你将由此获得大量的月亮知识，比如：月球的地容地貌、资源分布、光照条件、什么时间航舱费用最低、嫦娥最可能居住哪里、如何找到月桂树等等，在这样创造知识的家庭氛围下成长的孩子必然会成为情操高尚、眼界开阔的有为之士而赢在火星时代。可以说，是种下了一颗可贵的种子，启蒙崭新格调



阐述理论：探月、登月、驻月计划，信息先行——首先，需要把月球变成一个智慧星球

“A seamless Internet of things can truly achieve unmanned driving, can an unmanned engineering team work together to build your mansion for you ~”“无缝的物物互联才能真正实现无人驾驶啊、才能有无人的工程队协同为你施工打造你家豪宅嘛~”

“There is also the EARTH-MOON mobile phone, the EARTH-MOON issue of consensus. In this way, after the information networking, the moon car can be called, and the small workshop can also call each other without switching to avoid collisions and realize shuttle driving with Eyes-closed.”“还有地月手机、共识的地月号段。这样，信息联网以后就可以给月球小车通电话了，小车间也可以不用切换而互相通电话避免撞车实现闭眼穿梭驾驶啦！”

"Oh, then I see. A clever planet condensed by the wisdom of all members of the month family runs on the public blockchain and consensus information chain between the earth and the moon.Communicate the valuable geospatial information you collect and share from the space"“哦，那我明白了，一个月族的全员智慧凝结的聪明星球，运行在地月间的公有区块链、共识信息链，传送你细细采集分享的可贵的航天地理空间信息。”


To ensure the smooth implementation of the lunar exploration, moon landing, and monthly stationing, we choose information first—first, we will transform the moon into a smart planet, and we will have scattered beacon nodes in the earth and the moon to form a network to form a moon-connected network. Earth's consensus communication network; Secondly, sending instructions to form a consensus for the Internet of things to prepare for the moon landing; when everything is ready, it can form an unmanned, autonomous operation covering the moon. At this point, you can first launch some seeds to plant and fertilize in your own backyard, and then continue to send some of the things to decorate the home to the moon. In the near future, with the key handed over by the commissioned developer, you can enjoy the bag with ease：)保障探月、登月、驻月计划顺利实施，我们选择信息先行——首先，着手把月球改造成一个智慧星球，在地球和月亮中要有分散的信标节点形成联网，形成一个覆盖月球互联地球的共识通讯网络；其次，发送指令为自家的装备形成共识物联网为登月做前期准备；当一切就绪就可以形成覆盖月球的无人驾驶、自主操作。此时可以先发射一些种子在自家后院播种施肥，陆陆续续再把一些装修家居的东西先期送月。在不久以后，带上委托的开发商交给的钥匙，你就可以美滋滋轻松拎包入住啦:）

实用航天产品目录，持续上新中

Practical aerospace product catalogue, continuing to new
Q: Emphasize that the lunar information and equipment will be used first to protect the human landing on the moon. Is it possible to run the ownership and contract after the completion of the lunar informationization?问：强调先以月球信息化、设备化，进而保障人类的登月，是不是在月球信息化完成以后才能运行权属和约呢？

A: No, the nodes in which the Consensus Box operates are not limited by the “regional space”, but the consensus formed in the “information space”, that is, when the cornerstone contract begins to run on the earth, the tenure begins to be established. . The informationization of the moon is to use the blockchain function of the box to realize the secure communication under verification. However, the equipment fully utilizes the central Internet of Things property of the box, mobilizes the entire moon's facilities, and finally falls to the moon. Implementation, there is no bug here!答：不是的，共识盒子运行的节点并不以“地域的空间”作为限制，而是在“信息的空间”形成的共识，就是说在基石合约开始在地球上运行时候，权属就开始确立。而月球的信息化是再次利用了盒子的区块链功能实现验证下的安全通讯，然设备化则充分发挥盒子去中心性物联网属性，调动整个月球的设施共建，最终把登月落到实现处，这里没有bug！



宇宙那么大，一起去看看

The universe is so big, go see it together
People always have to look at it. After seeing the beauty of the moon, this healthy desire will lead people to the universe to continue to appreciate the beauty of the universe. The journey of the sun and the moon is in it; the stars are brilliant, all in it. When you have experienced everything and return to your home, you will be more cherished and cherish your homeland when you see the smoke. Good!人总是得陇望蜀的，见识月球之美后，这种健康的欲望将带领人们走向宇宙继续领略宇宙之美——日月之行，皆在其中；星瀚灿烂，皆为其里啦。 当你领略完一切回归家园，又见炊烟时一定会更珍爱更珍惜您的地球家园。不是吗！

PS. Landing on the moon is not just about thought, but also about action. Put your hands up and your head, and use the thinking spanning thousands of years to do what you are doing now. We choose the most useful areas of space travel for creation, and use small achievements as a way to attract others. Everyone is a scientist.PS. 登陆上月球，可不止于思想，还在于行动力。动手起来、开动脑袋，用跨越千年的思维，一点一滴做现在的事。我们选择太空之行最有用的领域进行创造，以小小成果作为抛砖引玉，人人都是科学家。

A. Additive manufacturing technology (commonly known as 3D printing) will surely be widely used in the space field in the future-think about it, there is a lack of interstellar navigational supplies, and a large number of personalized items need to be randomly used on-site.

In the lonely journey, astronauts need someone to chat, talk, arrange, and tell stories. Behind this is a series of serious sciences.孤单的旅程中，宇航员需要有人聊天、谈心、排遣、讲故事，这里的背后可是一系列严肃的科学嘛

During the lonely journey, astronauts need someone to chat, talk, arrange, and tell stories. Behind here is a series of serious and rigorous sciences. In short, for many people, there are still too many unknowable factors in space waiting to be exposed, and when they are completely safe, all difficulties have countermeasures before they live. Before the infrastructure is perfected and before the advancement team of the IoT can know that they know how to resist the dangers of the universe, it should be just a paradise for explorers and a sandbox of thought.孤单的旅程中，宇航员需要有人聊天、谈心、排遣、讲故事，这里的背后可是一系列严肃、严谨的科学嘛。 总之呢，对大对数人来说，太空中还有太多不可知因素等待暴露，等完全安全了，各个困难都有对策了再住上去。在基础设施完善之前、在物联先遣团能知己知彼抵抗宇宙危害前，应该只是探险者的乐园和思想沙盘的阵地。
